  "course_description": "This is an advanced course in game theory. We begin with a rigorous overview of the main\u00a0equilibrium concepts for non-\u00adcooperative games in both static and dynamic settings with either complete or incomplete information. We define and explore properties of iterated strict dominance, rationalizability, Nash equilibrium, subgame perfection, sequential, perfect and proper equilibria, the intuitive criterion, and iterated weak dominance. We discuss applications to auctions, bargaining, and repeated games. Then we introduce solution concepts for cooperative games and study non-\u00adcooperative implementations.\u00a0Other topics include matching theory and networks.\n",
